   <p> Im sorry, im stressed, and the campus is closed. I have no clue how to do the resizing thing. I spend over 15min combing through the book, despertely looking for answers. Your other projects have been easy, so I dont know why I am havin gthis much trouble. I cant find anything in the book, serching online isnt helpful, and there seems to be no resources in canvas to aid me. Maybe i am looking in the wrong areas, but I need help.
